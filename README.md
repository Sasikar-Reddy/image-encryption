üîê Image Encryption Using AES Algorithm Overview This project demonstrates the encryption and decryption of digital images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Python. By converting images into byte arrays and applying AES encryption, the project ensures that even if the encrypted images are accessed over the internet, they remain secure and indecipherable without the correct decryption key.

Objectives Implement AES encryption and decryption for image files.

Ensure data integrity and confidentiality during transmission.

Provide a user-friendly interface for encryption and decryption operations.

Features AES Encryption: Utilizes AES in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode for secure encryption.

Key Management: Supports secure key generation and storage.

Data Integrity: Implements HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to verify data integrity.

User Interface: Provides a command-line interface for ease of use.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

pip install pycryptodome Pillow numpy.

Secure Key Management Environment Variables: Store encryption keys in environment variables to prevent hardcoding in source code.

Key Derivation Functions: Use functions like PBKDF2 to derive keys from passwords securely.

Key Storage: Consider using secure storage solutions for key management.

Data Integrity HMAC: Implement HMAC with SHA-256 to verify the integrity of the encrypted data.

Verification: Before decrypting, verify that the HMAC matches the expected value to ensure data has not been tampered with.

Applications Secure Image Transmission: Protect images during transmission over unsecured networks.

Confidential Data Storage: Safeguard sensitive images stored on devices or cloud services.

Digital Forensics: Ensure the authenticity and integrity of image evidence.
